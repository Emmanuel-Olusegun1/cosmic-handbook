# Getting Started with Prisma

## Introduction

Prisma is a modern database toolkit for Node.js and TypeScript. It provides an intuitive API for working with databases and simplifies complex database operations.

## Installing Prisma

To start using Prisma, you first need to install it along with the Prisma CLI. This allows you to initialize a new Prisma project and interact with your database.

### Install Prisma via npm:

Run the following command in your terminal to install Prisma:

```sh
npm install @prisma/client prisma --save-dev
```

### Initializing a Prisma Project

After installing Prisma, initialize a new Prisma project by running:

```sh
npx prisma init
```

This will create a **prisma/** directory with a **schema.prisma** file, where you define your database models and configuration.

## Setting up the Database

Prisma supports multiple databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite. You need to configure your database connection in the **.env** file.

### Example Database Connection (PostgreSQL)

Open the **.env** file and update the 'DATABASE_URL' variable:

```sh
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/mydatabase?schema=public"
```

Replace 'USER', 'PASSWORD', and 'mydatabase' with your actual database credentials.

### Applying Database Migrations

After defining your database models in **schema.prisma**, apply the changes to your database using Prisma Migrate:

```sh
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This will create the necessary database tables based on your schema.

### Generating Prisma Client

After modifying your schema, run the following command to generate the Prisma Client:

```sh
npx prisma generate
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up Prisma, configured your database!
