## Database Migrations with Prisma Migrate

Prisma Migrate is a powerful tool for managing database schema changes and versioning. It ensures that database schema updates are tracked and applied in a structured way.

### Creating a Migration

After modifying the schema, run the following command to create a new migration:

```sh
npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name
```

Provide a meaningful `migration_name` to describe the changes made.

### Applying Migrations

To apply pending migrations in a production environment, use:

```sh
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

This ensures all migrations are executed in order.

### Rolling Back Migrations

During development, you can reset the database and reapply all migrations using:

```sh
npx prisma migrate reset
```

This will delete all data and recreate the schema.

### Checking Migration Status

To check which migrations have been applied and their status, run:

```sh
npx prisma migrate status
```

### Best Practices for Migrations

- Always review schema changes before running migrations.
- Use meaningful migration names for better tracking.
- In production, test migrations in a staging environment before deploying.
