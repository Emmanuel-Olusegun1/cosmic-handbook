# Getting Started with Express

## Introduction & Why Express?

Express is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It is widely used for building web applications and APIs due to its simplicity and flexibility.

### Why Choose Express?

Express provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It is lightweight, easy to use, and has a large ecosystem of middleware to extend its functionality.

## Installation & Setup

To start using Express, you first need to install it via npm:

### Install Express via npm in your terminal:

```sh
npm install express
```

### Importing the package

The latest ES version ES15 uses **import** instead of **require**. To do this:
Change the setting in your package.json.

```json
"type": "module"
```

### Now, let's create a simple server using Express

This basic setup initializes an Express application and defines a single route (/) that returns "Hello, Express!".

### Creating a basic Express Server

First create a file named **server.js** or any other filename with **.js** as the extension.
Write the following code:

```js
import express from "express";

const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, Express!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running at http://localhost:3000");
});
```

### Running the App in Node.js

To run the Express application, simply use Node.js:

```sh
node server.js
```

### Key Differences Between Express & Hono

Express is often compared with newer frameworks like Hono. Here are some key differences:

| Feature     | Express                      | Hono                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Performance | Moderate                     | Extremely fast (~2x faster) |
| Middleware  | Uses _**next()**_ function   | Uses a simple chain model   |
| Edge Ready  | No                           | Yes (Cloudflare, Deno, Bun) |
| Type Safety | Requires extra configuration | First-class TypeScript      |
| Routing     | Traditional Express routes   | Similar to Express          |

Express is ideal for traditional server-based applications, whereas Hono is optimized for serverless and edge deployments.
