# HTTP Methods

Express uses **.get()**, **.post()**, **.put()**, **.delete()**, and other HTTP methods to define routes.
Express supports various HTTP methods for handling client requests. Each method serves a specific purpose.

## Understanding req and res

In Express.js, req (request) and res (response) are objects provided by Express to handle HTTP requests and responses.

- **req (Request Object)**: Contains information about the incoming request, such as parameters, query strings, headers, and body data using **req.query**, **req.params** and many more.
- **res (Response Object)**: Provides methods to send a response back to the client, such as **res.send()**, **res.json()**, or **res.status()**.

Example:

### 1. GET Method

Used to **retrieve data** from the server.
Does not modify server data.

```js
app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Fetching all users");
});
```

### 2. POST Method

Used to **send data** to the server to create new resources.
Data is sent in the request body.

```js
app.post("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.send("User added successfully");
});
```

### 3. PUT Method

Used to **update an existing resource completely**.
Requires the full resource data in the request body.

```js
app.put("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`User with ID ${req.params.id} updated`);
});
```

### 4. DELETE Method

Used to **remove a resource** from the server.

```js
app.delete("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`User with ID ${req.params.id} deleted`);
});
```
